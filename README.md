DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a small Knife plugin for keeping track of various changes in your Chef environemnt.

In it's core it pulls the configuration of all your environements, roles, and nodes then saves them into json files in the place of your choosing and commits it using a local git repository. It can also pull/push them to a remote repostory for safekeeping.

The plugin is in an early alpha (as indicated by the commit dates) so things may change rather drastically in the near future.

USAGE
-----

Comming soon!
